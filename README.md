# Group7_FinalProject
 This project aims to simulate gene structure changes in several generations on different landscapes, since complex landscape is an important disturbing factor for stable gene structure of a large population. Except for population statistics like heterozygosity, it also provide a simple visualization for the distribution of the generation of different genotypes.
